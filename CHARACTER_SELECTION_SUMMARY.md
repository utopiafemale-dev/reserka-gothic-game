## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Asset Processing
- **Female Adventurer sprites**: 6x6 grid format, 64x64 per frame
- **Automatic frame extraction** with proper grid positioning
- **No auto-cropping** to maintain intended sprite dimensions
- **Scaling and processing** through PIL and Pygame integration

### Character System
```python
# Example: Character-specific setup
if self.character_id == 'female_adventurer':
    self.max_jumps = 3  # Triple jump
    self.dash_distance = 150
    self.dash_duration = 300
elif self.character_id == 'gothicvania_hero':
    self.max_jumps = 2  # Double jump
    self.dash_distance = 0  # No dash
```

### Animation Management

- Loop control for different animation behaviors
- Smooth animation transitions
